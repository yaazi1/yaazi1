- 👋 Hi, I’m Kazi, a NYC-based software engineer in the making.
- :bulb:  I spent ~4 years in college studying finance and economics only to realize that I liked code editors more than spreadsheets after taking an introductory level programming course in my last semester. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and its popular frameworks.
- 📫 I can be reached at kaaziahmed@gmail.com
