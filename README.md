- 👋 Hi, I’m Kazi, a NYC-based software engineer in the making.
- :bulb:  I spent 4.5 years in college learning about finance and economics only to do a complete 180 after taking an introductory level programming course in my last semester. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and some of its popular frameworks. When I'm not busy learning coding, I'm reading up on CS fundamentals. 
- 📫 I can be reached at kaaziahmed@gmail.com
